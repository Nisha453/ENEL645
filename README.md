## ENEL645 Final Project 

# SEX INFLUENCES USING MRI IMAGES

- The experiment consist of sex detection of two subjects from brain MRI's
- It focuses on three research questions 
	1. whether deep learning model accurately predict sex using brain images. 
	2. If the data is trained using one subject then how it will works while predicting opposite sex
	3. What region of the brain images responsible to determine the sex of subject. 

## How to get started with this experiment ?

- For this project we have consider 4000 images of male and female brains from https://portal.conp.ca/dataset?id=projects/calgary-campinas
- Clone this repository and go to Code/Resnet.ipynb. The given dataset can be load to this notebook and can start with this experiment. 
- The dataset used in the Resnet.ipynb is NewTrain4K which is similar to the dataset uploaded in this repository.
